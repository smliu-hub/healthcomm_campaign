Welcome to our journey into the fascinating world of Language Models (LLMs) and their impact on raising awareness about egg allergies in young children aged 0-3. In today's digital age, social media platforms like Instagram serve as powerful tools for spreading important messages and educating the community about various health concerns. In this blog, we delve into our innovative approach of utilizing LLMs to prompt Instagram posts aimed at increasing awareness of egg allergies among parents and caregivers.

Our research is centered around a unique **2x2 experiment** designed to uncover the most effective types of prompts for Instagram posts. We explore the variables of narrative versus informative content, as well as positive versus negative tones. By systematically testing these different combinations, we aim to identify the most impactful strategies for engaging our audience and encouraging proactive measures to safeguard children with egg allergies.
